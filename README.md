 Biostatistics1 - Lab5

### Question 1.
Modify your function from the Problem 2 (Lab5 Activity). The function should simulate N rounds of the game (instead of just one) and return the proportion of times you win the bet. Run the function with N=1,000 and N=10,000.

### Question 2.
Write a function that will find the smallest element of a given vector (built-in **`min()`** is not allowed). Your function should return the smallest element and index of the smallest element.

Ex. vector is (1, 4, 2, 0, 5), then the smallest element - 0 and index is 4.
